AGM
===
The UK Research Software Engineering community was founded in 2012 to support the people who develop software used in research (details on http://www.rse.ac.uk). We hold a yearly AGM at different locations in the UK in order to build the community, network, and share best practices.

This repository keeps track of the presentations & other material used at each AGM. More information can always be found in the Wiki.
