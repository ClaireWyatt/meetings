AGM
===
The Research Software Engineers community was founded to support the people who develop software used in research. If you want be a part of the community, come to our AGM and hackday which takes place on 15-16 September at King’s College London. It’s a free event thanks to our sponsor Maudsley Digital (no11WW).

Back in March 2012, we began raising awareness of the research community’s reliance on RSEs. In the last last year, we have made excellent progress in gaining recognition for RSEs. In the coming year, we want to continue this work, and attract more people to the community so that we have the weight of numbers to change how academia deals with its software developers.
