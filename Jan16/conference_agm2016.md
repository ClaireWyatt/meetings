# Notes about the planned Conference/AGM in September 2016

Past nothing - now got money Â£5000 and have effort from Claire
to help organise and sponsors

Big problem was getting venue last time. Now this time we can get
a venue

Decided last time it was collaborations workshop. Wanting
it sometime between the collaborations workshops, so decided
that is should be in September. Decided that we will look at
the second week of September.

We have agreed that we will look at a 2 day workshop that will
mix talks and training.

The aim will definitely be to have a conference that has an
attached AGM, rather than an AGM with attached conference.

# AGM requirements
What do we have to do? Need to present a report, plans for the 
future, and vote on who is on the council / constitution?

# Plan for conference

- 2 day conference
- Have an AGM after 4pm before the conference dinner.
  This could be based on pre-circulated and pre-circulated minutes
  and to vote on decisions. Discussions will take place during short break-out
  sessions held in parallel to the talks in the morning.
- Conference dinner in the evening

# Talk format

(1) How an RSE helped a scientific project talks
(2) Here's a new piece of technology and how it can be used 
    (e.g. docker, threaded building blocks, etc.). Looking
    for intermediate - advanced topics to excite potential
    RSE and software developer attendees.

# Sponsors

Sponsors can contribute a talk and workshop (attractive to sponsors).
Sponsor could also provide a cloud on which to run the workshops.

Sponsors could include
- microsoft, github, software carpentry, nag, docker, mathworks, amazon, google
- Tessella, Allinea

# Reaching out to the community

We also want to reach out to the community, e.g. funding councils and also
to other countries, e.g. USA.

Will want to invite EPSRC / BBSRC / STFC etc. to show impact of funding
and to encourage other RCs to develop an RSE programme. We should definitely
have talks from some RSE Fellows to demonstrate impact.

# Plenary talks

Perhaps a plenary would from software carpentry.

# Audience

Intermediate and advanced RSEs/programmers. Not targetting
basic or new programmers.

We are agreed to target RSEs but allow researchers to come.
This will help with parallel sessions parallel sessions will
help broaden appeal.

Aiming for 150 participants.

# Possible workshops

- docker workshop

# Decisions
1. Call for participation
 - actions - someone write a call for proposals. Will do once 
 calendar is in place.
 
2. Commercial entities to be able to sponsor proposals

# Plan for a day
~20 participants per parallel workshop session? 

# Venues 
Steer to somewhere north of London, e.g. Manchester? Need
somewhere that can be reached within ~2.5-3.0 hours by
most people.

# Resolved will be mid september
- 2 days
- morning will be talks, afternoon will be workshops
 - voting will in the evening around the conference dinner

# Action - calendar of what we need to do and when (Simon H)

# Plan
4 talk sessions in the morning, 2 workshop sessions in the afternoon
(also have breakout sessions in the morning)

First national RSE conference - invite someone from the US

Set up a slack channel?

Like to have it in Manchester - Mike has offered tech support
